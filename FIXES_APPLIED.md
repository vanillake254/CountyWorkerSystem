# Fixes Applied - County Worker Platform

## 🔧 Issue 1: Invalid Token Error - FIXED ✅

### Problem
The "Invalid token" error was appearing when:
- Applicants tried to apply for jobs
- Admin tried to create/edit/delete jobs
- Admin tried to create/edit/delete departments

### Root Cause
`flutter_secure_storage` doesn't work properly on web browsers. The token was being saved but not retrieved correctly.

### Solution
**Changed token storage from `flutter_secure_storage` to `shared_preferences`:**

**File:** `/frontend/lib/services/api_service.dart`
```dart
// BEFORE (didn't work on web)
import 'package:flutter_secure_storage/flutter_secure_storage.dart';
final _storage = const FlutterSecureStorage();

// AFTER (works on web and mobile)
import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';

Future<String?> getToken() async {
  final prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
  return prefs.getString('auth_token');
}
```

### Impact
✅ Token now persists correctly on web
✅ All authenticated API calls work properly
✅ No more "Invalid token" errors

## 🔧 Issue 2: Missing Supervisor Management - FIXED ✅

- Add supervisors

## 🔧 Issue 3: Enhanced CORS Configuration - FIXED ✅

### Problem

```python
# BEFORE
CORS(app)

# AFTER
CORS(app, resources={r"/*": {"origins": "*"}}, supports_credentials=True)
```

### Impact
